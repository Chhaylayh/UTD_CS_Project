# CS 2340 - Computer Architecture

## Course Description  
Introduces the concepts of computer architecture by going through multiple levels of abstraction, the numbering systems and their basic computations. It focuses on the instruction-set architecture of the MIPS machine, including MIPS assembly programming, translation between MIPS and C, and between MIPS and machine code. General topics include performance calculation, processor datapath, pipelining, and memory hierarchy.

## Project
The assignment was to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using MIPS Assembl Language
