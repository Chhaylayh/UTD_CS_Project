MIPS Tic Tac Toe Game User Manual

1. 	At start of the game, the game board will be displayed with the cells numbered 1-9 as a visual reference and the user will be prompted to select either an X or O as their respective character while the computer selects one of the two characters that is not used.
2. 	Next, the user will be prompted to select which cell they would like to place their character in as their move.
3. 	Then the user will see the updated board display with their character in the cell that they have chosen.
4. 	The computer will place its character in an empty cell and the user will see the updated board display again this time with the computerâ€™s move.
5. 	The user and computer will continue taking turns until one player has three in a row of their respective character either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to be declared as the winner.
6. 	In the event that all cells on the game board are filled up with neither player having three in a row, then the game is declared as a tie/draw.
7. 	Once the game is over, the user can clear the console output fully and then they can play the game again if they want to.
