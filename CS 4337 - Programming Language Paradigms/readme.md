# CS 4337 - Programming Language Paradigms


## Course Description  
Principles of design and implementation of contemporary programming languages. Formal description including specification of syntax and semantics of programming languages. Language definition structures including binding, scoping, data types, control structures, parameter passing, abstraction mechanism, and run-time considerations. Design issues of different programming languages. Language-based security. Design, implement, and debug programs in various programming language paradigms


## Project 1
In this project you will create an expression calculator. The calculator will prompt the user for an expression in prefix notation and calculate the result of the inputted expression. A history will be kept so that previous results can be used in expressions. You are expected to handle possible errors in the userâ€™s input.

## Project 2
In this project you will write a prolog program that can solve a maze, creating a predicate find exit/2 for the user to query.
