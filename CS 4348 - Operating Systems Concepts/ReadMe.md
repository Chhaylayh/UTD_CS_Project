CS 4348 - Operating Systems Concepts
Course Description
An introduction to fundamental concepts in operating systems: their design, implementation, and usage. Topics include process management, main memory management, virtual memory, I/O and device drivers, file systems, secondary storage management, and an introduction to critical sections and deadlocks.

Project 1
The assignment was to simulate a computer's CPU and memory and the communication between them. The CPU and Memory classes are run as separate processes, and they communicate via input and output streams.

Project 2
The assignment was to simulate a movie theater box office, with multiple agents and customers. Each agent or customer was represented as a separate thread, and coordination between agents and customers were facilitated with semaphores to get customers through the simulation.

Project 3
The assignment was to create a server that managed ticket reservations, and a client that connected to and communicated with the server through sockets.
