# Bonus

## Objective
The last week of lectures has time scheduled for presentations. At the beginning of each class, Dr. Becker will ask if anyone would like to demonstrate their bonus application. The cohort would present their system to the class, and this application needs to have a wow factor. A simple dialog system of black, grey, and white will not do. There should be sound, pictures, movies, charts, graphs, animations. The class then will ask the cohort questions.
