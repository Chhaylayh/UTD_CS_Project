# CS 4347 - Database Systems

## Course Description  
This course emphasizes the concepts and structures necessary for the design and implementation of database management systems. Topics include data models, data normalization, data description languages, query facilities, file organization, index organization, file security, data integrity, and reliability.

## Project
The project is divided into 4 parts with a part for bonus.

### Part 1
To begin the modelling aspect of constructing a database for the Database Class. The goal of the project is to build the database, not the database application.

### Part 2
To perform the next step of data modelling for constructing a database. For this part of the project, the Extended Entity Relationship Diagram from part 1 must be converted into a Relational Schema Diagram.

### Part 3
The next step in the project is to select a Database Management System and to build the database tables. For this part of the project, the Relational Schema Dictionary must be converted into a Relational Database.

### Part 4
The final step in the project is to populate the database tables and to run SQL queries on that data. For this part of the project, data must be generated and stored in the database tables before the queries are executed.

### Bonus
The last week of lectures has time scheduled for presentations. At the beginning of each class, Dr. Becker will ask if anyone would like to demonstrate their bonus application. The cohort would present their system to the class, and this application needs to have a wow factor. A simple dialog system of black, grey, and white will not do. There should be sound, pictures, movies, charts, graphs, animations. The class then will ask the cohort questions.
