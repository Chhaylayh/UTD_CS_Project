# CS 4348 - Operating Systems Concepts

### Course Description  
An introduction to fundamental concepts in operating systems: their design, implementation, and usage. Topics include process management, main memory management, virtual memory, I/O and device drivers, file systems, secondary storage management, and an introduction to critical sections and deadlocks.

## Project 1
The assignment was to simulate a computer's CPU and memory and the communication between them. The CPU and Memory classes are run as separate processes, and they communicate via input and output streams.

## Project 2
This project will simulate a visit to the doctor’s office.  It is similar to the “barbershop” example in the textbook. 

## Project 3 
This project will simulate a scheduler scheduling a set of jobs.
The project will allow the user to execute a set of scheduling algorithms on an input set of jobs.  It will output a representation of how the jobs are executed. The clinic to be simulated has doctors, each of which has their own nurse.  Each doctor has an office of his or her own in which to visit patients.  Patients will enter the clinic to see a doctor, which should be randomly assigned.  Initially, a patient enters the waiting room and waits to register with the receptionist.  Once registered, the patient sits in the waiting room until the nurse calls.  The receptionist lets the nurse know a patient is waiting.  The nurse directs the patient to the doctor’s office and tells the doctor that a patient is waiting.  The doctor visits the patient and listens to the patient’s symptoms.  The doctor advises the patient on the action to take.  The patient then leaves.
