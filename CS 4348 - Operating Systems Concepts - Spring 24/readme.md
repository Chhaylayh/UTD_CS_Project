# CS 4348 - Operating Systems Concepts

### Course Description  
An introduction to fundamental concepts in operating systems: their design, implementation, and usage. Topics include process management, main memory management, virtual memory, I/O and device drivers, file systems, secondary storage management, and an introduction to critical sections and deadlocks.

## Project 1
The project will simulate a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and Memory. The CPU and Memory will be simulated by separate processes that communicate. Memory will contain one program that the CPU will execute and then the simulation will end.

## Project 2
This project will simulate a visit to the doctor’s office.  It is similar to the “barbershop” example in the textbook. 

## Project 3 
<p>This project will simulate a scheduler scheduling a set of jobs.</p>
<p>The project will allow the user to execute a set of scheduling algorithms on an input set of jobs.  It will output a representation of how the jobs are executed. </p>
